                <p>1. c<br>
                    Explanation: Hill cipher uses matrix multiplication in order to encrypt the given plain text. So it requires prerequisite 
                    knowledge of matrix algebra.</p>
                    <p>2. b<br>
                        Explanation: Hill cipher is a substitution cipher. It falls under the category of poly alphabetic cipher as it uses 
                        multiple substitutions at different positions in order to cipher the plain text.</p>
                        <p>3. a<br>
                            Explanation: Encryption of plain text in playfair cipher is done using matrix multiplication. Then modulo 26 of the 
                            resulting matrix is taken so as to get the ciphered text.</p>
                            <p>4. c<br>
                                Explanation: Poly graphic cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which substitution is performed over a block 
                                of letters. Hill cipher is an example of poly graphic cipher.</p>
                                <p>5. a<br>
                                    Explanation: A key matrix used for encryption in hill cipher must be invertible matrix. Otherwise it will be
                                     impossible to decipher the message.</p>
                                     <p>6. a<br>
                                        Explanation: We first convert the keyword and plain text into their corresponding matrix respectively. 
                                        Then we multiply those matrix and take modulo 26 of the resulting matrix to get the ciphered text.</p>
                                         <p>7. b<br>
                                            Explanation: Poly graphic cipher is a type of substitution cipher in which substitution is performed over a block of letters. 
                                            Hill cipher was the first poly graphic cipher to be able to operate on more than 3 letters at once.</p>
                                             <p>8. d<br>
                                                Explanation: Hill cipher uses a n x n matrix in order to cipher the plain text. In this case n=6 so a 6x6 matrix will be used.</p>
                                                 <p>9. a<br>
                                                    Explanation: To decrypt the message we follow the reverse procedure. We first find the inverse
                                                     of the keyword matrix then multiply it with cipher matrix.</p>
                                                     <p>10. b<br>
                                                        Explanation: Both hill cipher and playfair cipher are less vulnerable to frequency analysis. But hill cipher
                                                         is quite vulnerable to other forms of attack and thus less secure than playfair cipher.</p>
